Hi, Iâ€™m Rich Acosta / @Ricapar.

By day I am a developer, engineer, and cloud architect, specializing in enabling enterprise developers,
DevOps teams, and infrastructure specialists to make the most of the public cloud.

By night I run a homelab, build home automation scripts, and collect and restore vintage video game
and computer systems.
